## Nintendo Wii

The Wii was a massive console back in the day. Although it is long past its prime, I will always adore the Wii for how revolutionary it was. Jailbreaking a Wii is very easy, and there are mulitple ways to go about it. I used the wifi method for the homebrew channel because it was the simplest. Embarassingly though, I learned the hard way to read to the end of the instructions prior to starting the jailbreak. On my family's childhood Wii, I read half the instructions and assumed I could guess the rest of the process. I ended up bricking that Wii and quickly had to buy a replacement off someone to cover my mess. The second time around I was much more careful.

 Here are three classics everyone should try:
 - Super Mario Galaxy 2 (2010)
 - Twilight Princess (2006)
 - Super Smash Bros. Brawl (2008)
