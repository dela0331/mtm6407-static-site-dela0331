## Jailbreaks

Jailbreaking is be very broad, but can be described as "breaking out" of the limitations set by the devs to gain the freedom to install games and applications. Many people jailbreak their consoles to improve performance, to pirate, to play homebrews, and so much more. As for me, I jailbroke a Wii and a 3Ds to play games that were no longer being sold for their original console. As mentioned in the Flash Carts section, once games are no longer in production, the price for the physical copy skyrockets.

Below are some more details about them!
