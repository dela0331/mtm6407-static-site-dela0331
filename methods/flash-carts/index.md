## Flash Carts

Flash carts are fantastic for when you have the original console, but don't want to have to buy individual game cartidges. Once the cartridges are no longer being produced, they can becomes very expensive very quickly. A Flash Cart allows you to download roms onto the cart, then use that as a sort of universal cartridge in the console. I have/had Flash Carts for N64 and DS.

Below are some more details about them!
