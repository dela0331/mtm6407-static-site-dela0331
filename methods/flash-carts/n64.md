## Nintendo 64

I have an old N64, however I was not able to find and game cartridges for it. I'd rather not spend upwards of $100 for every game I wanted to play, so I invested in an Everdrive64 and found the ROMs for all the games I wanted to play. Someone in the neighbourhood was giving away an old 20" CRT tv in almost perfect condition! Being able to play N64 on the original console with a CRT tv is such a cool experience.

 Here are three classics everyone should try:
 - Ocarina of Time (1998)
 - Majora's Mask (2000)
 - Golden Eye (1997)
