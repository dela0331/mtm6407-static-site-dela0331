## Nintendo DS

When I was a kid, my brother got an R4 for his DS. This would've been around 2007-2008. I couldn't really understand what it or how it worked, but for years I would spend hours at a time watching him play (and cheat) so many different games. I think this probably kickstarted a lifelong adoration for games. Although that R4 is long lost, I have to give credit where credit is due.

 Here are three classics everyone should try:
 - Spirit Tracks (2009)
 - Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky (2009)
 - Pokémon Diamond and Pearl (2006)
