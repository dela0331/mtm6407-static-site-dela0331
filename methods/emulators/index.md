## Emulators

Emulation is my favourite method of playing old games. It's quick, easy, and allows for a wide range of gameplay and visual customization depending on what emulator is being used. Once the emulator is set up, all you need to do is load in your ROMs and the software should handle the rest. Personally, I mostly use emulation for PS1 and PS2 games.

Below are some more details about them!
