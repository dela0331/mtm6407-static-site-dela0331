## Playstation 2

For the Playstation 2, I use the PSX2 emulator on PC. Same as the PS1, the only minor inconvenience is looking for a BIOS key.

The PS2 was a huge step forward for games in general. Developers now had a pretty solid grasp on 3D environments, and evolved from tank controls to the modern standard for 3D environments and gameplay that we still use today. As much as I love the PS1, I did not grow up with tank controls and admittedly prefer the PS2's gameplay for that reason. 

 Here are three classics everyone should try:
 - Shadow of the Colossus (2005)
 - Oni (2001)
 - Silent Hill 2 (2001)
