## Playstation

For the Playstation, I use the Duckstation emulator on PC. Installation and setup is very easy. The only tricky part can be finding the BIOS key, but that's nothing a few minutes of digging can't solve.

I really love PS1 visuals. Every year there are more and more advancements made to graphics in games, but every generation of consoles has its own charm. I think it's important to look back on them and appreciate how developers made do with the hardware limitations of the time. Vertex snapping, pixelation, and dithering are all staples of PS1 graphics - and it's wonderful to look at. 

 Here are three classics everyone should try:
 - Ghost in the Shell (1997)
 - Silent Hill (1999)
 - Metal Gear Solid (1998)
